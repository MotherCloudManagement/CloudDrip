### Architecture

The CloudDrip architecture is composed of three parts: Backend (SDK Level, proprietary cloud_kernel, Apache Kafka), Database (proprietary cloud_kernel, MySQL Database), and the Frontend (Django/Bootstrap Web Application, Zabbix & Jira Integration).  This architecture creates a fault taulerant environment, while also keeping the application lightweight.  Extendable Modules can be added easily by administrators, without any disruption to web application services.
